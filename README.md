# Recommendations:
Mojio's success and capability has proven that the company should sustian and grow if the technology and industry desires buliding telematics as a core estimator and monitoring device for insurance industry and other customers. 
I would still recommend to build the platform more resilient to cyber threats. Due to the increase online usage worldwide , the cyber perpetrators are actively seeking opportunities. Recommendations follows,
-implementing secure data transfer (data privacy)
-digitally sign updates.
-enable hardware code protection (microcontroller) & assume code is public.
-Use cryptographically strong random numbers.
-Individualize security data
-use different keys for different roles.
-perform 3rd party auditing.
-Disable debug features
-Limit Service access
-Apply secure design practice
-implement support for software/firmware updates.
-Verify & test
-Develop security culture.
